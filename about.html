                                        Vellalar College for Women traces its roots to the year 1970 when the farsighted visionaries of the soil led a
                                        mission to educate and empower the first generation women scholars of the locale, specifically those from rural, 
                                        underprivileged sections of the society to become leaders and contributors to every sector of the society.
                                        For more than four and half decades, the institution has passed many groundbreaking milestones and forged 
                                        benchmarking traditions eventually evolving into the eye of conscience of the society. With a sizeable students’ 
                                        strength of 6,000 students in the under-graduate and the post-graduate programmes in the Aided and the Unaided 
                                        sections, the institution espouses the cause of ‘Education for Life’ enabling every graduating scholar to find 
                                        her niche and to strike a successful balance between academic life and otherwise. The institution’s cogent vision 
                                        and mission of consummate scholastic service has enabled it to evolve into College with Potential for Excellence 
                                        in 2010 and currently accorded with the II turn of CPE funds which speaks for its consistency in academic 
                                        excellence.. Conferred with the status of autonomy in 2007 and re-accredited by NAAC with ‘A’ grade in 2015 
                                        in the third cycle with the CGPA of 3.43 the institution continues to equip the students with intellectual,
                                        moral, spiritual and physical credentials to lead a purposeful life and to effect a positive difference in 
                                        the world they cohabit.
